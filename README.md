## Why Prism?

Every time you start a new conversation with an AI coding assistant, it starts from scratch. You re-explain your architecture, re-describe your decisions, re-list your TODOs. Hours of context — gone.

**Prism gives your agent a brain that persists.** Save what matters at the end of each session. Load it back instantly on the next one. Your agent remembers what it did, what it learned, and what's left to do.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start


Add to your MCP client config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note on Windows/Restricted Shells:** If your MCP client complains that `npx` is not found, use the absolute path to your node binary (e.g. `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`) or install globally with caution.

**That's it.** Restart your client. All tools are available. Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. 
*(Note: The MCP server automatically starts this UI on port 3000 when connected. If you have a Next.js/React app running, port 3000 might already be in use.)*

> 🔑 **API Key Requirements:** The core Mind Palace (SQLite/FTS5) works 100% offline. However, if you need semantic search, Morning Briefings, or auto-compaction, provide a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini) or equivalent. Want Web Scholar to search the live internet? Provide a `BRAVE_API_KEY`. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Migration

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrating Existing History (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI)</strong></summary>

Prism can ingest months of historical sessions from other tools to give your Mind Palace a massive head start. Import via the **CLI** or directly from the [Mind Palace Dashboard](#-mind-palace-dashboard) Import tab (file picker + manual path + dry-run toggle).

### Supported Formats
* **Claude Code** (`.jsonl` logs) — Automatically handles streaming chunk deduplication and `requestId` normalization.
* **Gemini** (JSON history arrays) — Supports large-file streaming for 100MB+ exports.
* **OpenAI** (JSON chat completion history) — Normalizes disparate tool-call structures into the unified Ledger schema.

### How to Run

**Option 1 — CLI:**

```bash
# Ingest Claude Code history
npx -y prism-mcp-server universal-import --format claude --path ~/path/to/claude_log.jsonl --project my-project

# Dry run (verify mapping without saving)
npx -y prism-mcp-server universal-import --format gemini --path ./gemini_history.json --dry-run
```

**Option 2 — Dashboard:** Open `localhost:3000`, navigate to the **Import** tab, select the format and file, and click Import. Supports dry-run preview. See the [dashboard screenshot](#-mind-palace-dashboard) above.

### Key Features
* **OOM-Safe Streaming:** Processes massive log files line-by-line using `stream-json`.
* **Idempotent Dedup:** Content-hash prevents duplicate imports on re-run (`skipCount` reported).
* **Chronological Integrity:** Uses timestamp fallbacks and `requestId` sorting to ensure your memory timeline is accurate.
* **Smart Context Mapping:** Extracts `cwd`, `gitBranch`, and tool usage patterns into searchable metadata.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code — Lifecycle Autoload (.clauderules)</strong></summary>

Claude Code naturally picks up MCP tools by adding them to your workspace `.clauderules`. Simply add:

```markdown
Always start the conversation by calling `mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context(project='my-project', level='deep')`.
When wrapping up, always call `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger` and `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff`.
```

> **Format Note:** Claude automatically wraps MCP tools with double underscores (`mcp__prism-mcp__...`), while most other clients use single underscores (`mcp_prism-mcp_...`). Prism's backend natively handles both formats seamlessly.

</details>

<details id="antigravity-auto-load">
<summary><strong>Gemini / Antigravity — Prompt Auto-Load</strong></summary>

See the [Gemini Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md) for the proven three-layer prompt architecture to ensure reliable session auto-loading.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Supabase Cloud Sync</strong></summary>

To sync memory across machines or teams:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PRISM_STORAGE": "supabase",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "your-supabase-anon-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See the **Supabase Setup** section below for schema migration instructions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Clone & Build (Full Control)</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp.git
cd prism-mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

Then add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/prism-mcp/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-gemini-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Common Installation Pitfalls

> **❌ Don't use `npm install -g`:**
> Hardcoding the binary path (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/23.x/bin/prism-mcp-server`) is tied to a specific Node.js version — when Node updates, the path silently breaks.
>
> **✅ Always use `npx` instead:**
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "prism-mcp": {
>       "command": "npx",
>       "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
> `npx` resolves the correct binary automatically, always fetches the latest version, and works identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Already installed globally? Run `npm uninstall -g prism-mcp-server` first.

> **❓ Seeing warnings about missing API keys on startup?**
> That's expected and not an error. `BRAVE_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` warnings are informational only — core session memory works with zero keys. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for what each key unlocks.

## ✨ What Makes Prism Different


### 🧠 Your Agent Learns From Mistakes
When you correct your agent, Prism tracks it. Corrections accumulate **importance** over time. High-importance lessons auto-surface as warnings in future sessions — and can even sync to your `.cursorrules` file for permanent enforcement. Your agent literally gets smarter the more you use it.

### 🕰️ Time Travel
Every save creates a versioned snapshot. Made a mistake? `memory_checkout` reverts your agent's memory to any previous state — like `git revert` for your agent's brain. Full version history with optimistic concurrency control.

### 🔮 Mind Palace Dashboard
A gorgeous glassmorphism UI at `localhost:3000` that lets you see exactly what your agent is thinking:

- **Current State & TODOs** — the exact context injected into the LLM's prompt
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph** — force-directed neural graph with click-to-filter, node renaming, and surgical keyword deletion *(v5.1)*
- **Deep Storage Manager** — preview and execute vector purge operations with dry-run safety *(v5.1)*
- **Session Ledger** — full audit trail of every decision your agent has made
- **Time Travel Timeline** — browse and revert any historical handoff version
- **Visual Memory Vault** — browse VLM-captioned screenshots and auto-captured HTML states
- **Hivemind Radar** — real-time active agent roster with role, task, and heartbeat
- **Morning Briefing** — AI-synthesized action plan after 4+ hours away
- **Brain Health** — memory integrity scan with one-click auto-repair

![Mind Palace Dashboard](docs/mind-palace-dashboard.png)

### 🧬 10× Memory Compression
Powered by a pure TypeScript port of Google's TurboQuant (Inspired by ICLR), Prism compresses 768-dim embeddings from **3,072 bytes → ~400 bytes** — enabling decades of session history on a standard laptop. No native modules. No vector database required.

### 🐝 Multi-Agent Hivemind
Multiple agents (dev, QA, PM) can work on the same project with **role-isolated memory**. Agents discover each other automatically, share context in real-time via Telepathy sync, and see a team roster during context loading.

### 🖼️ Visual Memory
Save UI screenshots, architecture diagrams, and bug states to a searchable vault. Images are auto-captioned by a VLM (Claude Vision / GPT-4V / Gemini) and become semantically searchable across sessions.

### 🔭 Full Observability
OpenTelemetry spans for every MCP tool call, LLM hop, and background worker. Route to Jaeger, Grafana, or any OTLP collector. Configure in the dashboard — zero code changes.

## 🌐 Autonomous Web Scholar
Prism researches while you sleep. A background pipeline searches the web, scrapes articles, synthesizes findings via LLM, and injects results directly into your semantic memory — fully searchable on your next session. Brave Search → Firecrawl scrape → LLM synthesis → Prism ledger. Task-aware, Hivemind-integrated, and zero-config when API keys are missing (falls back to Yahoo + Readability).

### 🔒 GDPR Compliant
Soft/hard delete (Art. 17), full ZIP export (Art. 20), API key redaction, per-project TTL retention, and audit trail. Enterprise-ready out of the box.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Long-running feature work** — Save state at end of day, restore full context next morning. No re-explaining.

**Multi-agent collaboration** — Dev, QA, and PM agents share real-time context without stepping on each other's memory.

**Consulting / multi-project** — Switch between client projects with progressive loading: `quick` (~50 tokens), `standard` (~200), or `deep` (~1000+).

**Visual debugging** — Save UI screenshots to searchable memory. Find that CSS bug from last week by description.

**Team onboarding** — New team member's agent loads the full project history instantly.

**Behavior enforcement** — Agent corrections auto-graduate into permanent `.cursorrules` / `.clauderules` rules.

**Offline / air-gapped** — Full SQLite local mode + Ollama LLM adapter. Zero internet dependency.

**Morning Briefings** — After 4+ hours away, Prism auto-synthesizes a 3-bullet action plan from your last sessions.

## Architecture

Prism is a **stdio-based MCP server** that manages persistent agent memory. Here's how the pieces fit together:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP Client (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Antigravity)      │
│                    ↕ stdio (JSON-RPC)                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Prism MCP Server                                        │
│                                                          │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐  │
│  │  30+ Tools   │  │  Lifecycle   │  │   Dashboard    │  │
│  │  (handlers)  │  │  (PID lock,  │  │  (HTTP :3000)  │  │
│  │              │  │   shutdown)  │  │                │  │
│  └──────┬───────┘  └──────────────┘  └────────────────┘  │
│         ↕                                                │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Storage Engine                                    │  │
│  │  Local: SQLite + FTS5 + TurboQuant vectors         │  │
│  │  Cloud: Supabase + pgvector                        │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│         ↕                                                │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Background Workers                                │  │
│  │  • Scheduler (TTL, decay, compaction, purge)       │  │
│  │  • Web Scholar (Brave → Firecrawl → LLM → Ledger)  │  │
│  │  • Hivemind heartbeats & Telepathy broadcasts      │  │
│  │  • OpenTelemetry span export                       │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Startup Sequence

1. **Acquire PID lock** — prevents duplicate instances per `PRISM_INSTANCE`
2. **Initialize config** — SQLite settings cache (`prism-config.db`)
3. **Register 30+ MCP tools** — session, knowledge, search, behavioral, hivemind
4. **Connect stdio transport** — MCP handshake with the client (~60ms total)
5. **Async post-connect** — storage warmup, dashboard launch, scheduler start (non-blocking)

### Storage Layers

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Session Ledger** | SQLite (append-only) | Immutable audit trail of all agent work |
| **Handoff State** | SQLite (upsert, versioned) | Live project context with OCC + CRDT merging |
| **Keyword Search** | FTS5 virtual tables | Zero-dependency full-text search |
| **Semantic Search** | TurboQuant compressed vectors | 10× compressed 768-dim embeddings, three-tier retrieval |
| **Cloud Sync** | Supabase + pgvector | Optional multi-device/team sync |

### Auto-Load Architecture

Each MCP client has its own mechanism for ensuring Prism context loads on session start. See the platform-specific [Setup Guides](#-setup-guides) above for detailed instructions:

- **Claude Code** — Lifecycle hooks (`SessionStart` / `Stop`)
- **Gemini / Antigravity** — Three-layer architecture (User Rules + AGENTS.md + Startup Skill)
- **Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code** — System prompt instructions

All platforms benefit from the **server-side fallback** (v5.2.1): if `session_load_context` hasn't been called within 10 seconds, Prism auto-pushes context via `sendLoggingMessage`.

---

## Research Roadmap

Prism is evolving from smart session logging toward a **cognitive memory architecture** — grounded in real research, not marketing.

### v6.2: The "Synthesize & Prune" Phase
The v6.1 update laid the groundwork for Semantic Vector Search and basic Knowledge Gardening. The v6.2 phase aims to turn the collected data into proactive intelligence, moving the dashboard from a passive storage viewer into an active, self-organizing Mind Palace.

1. 🕸️ **Automated Edge Synthesis (The "Dream" Procedure):** A background routine that runs on the graph payload to find semantically similar but disconnected nodes via Cosine Similarity. It highlights potential ghostly edges in the UI, empowering the system to autonomously suggest new mental models instead of waiting for the user to connect the dots manually.
2. 🗓️ **Temporal Decay Heatmaps (Visualizing the Ebbinghaus Curve):** A UI overlay toggle where un-accessed nodes dynamically desaturate or physically "fade" while Graduated nodes (Score >= 7) stay vibrant longer. This makes the "Deep Purge" decision-making visceral: if the graph looks gray, trigger a learning session or a cleanup.
3. 📝 **Active Recall Prompt Generation (Knowledge Activation):** A "Test Me" utility in the `nodeEditorPanel`. Using a node's semantic neighbors, the dashboard generates synthetic quizzes to ensure context retention, pushing the product away from pure "storage" into genuine "active learning" capabilities.
4. 📦 **Zero-Dependency "Prism-Port" (Export & Interop):** A one-click "Export Vault" Graph-to-Markdown feature that compiles a `.zip` of linked `.md` chunks supporting Wikilinks `[[Node]]` integration with Obsidian/Logseq—honoring full data sovereignty.

## Limitations

- **LLM-dependent features require an API key.** Semantic search, Morning Briefings, auto-compaction, and VLM captioning need a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini) or equivalent provider key. Without one, Prism falls back to keyword-only search (FTS5).
- **Auto-load is model- and client-dependent.** Session auto-loading relies on both the LLM following system prompt instructions *and* the MCP client completing tool registration before the model's first turn. Prism provides platform-specific [Setup Guides](#-setup-guides) and a server-side fallback (v5.2.1) that auto-pushes context after 10 seconds.
- **MCP client race conditions.** Some MCP clients may not finish tool enumeration before the model generates its first response, causing transient `unknown_tool` errors. This is a client-side timing issue — Prism's server completes the MCP handshake in ~60ms. Workaround: the server-side auto-push fallback and the startup skill's retry logic.
- **No real-time sync without Supabase.** Local SQLite mode is single-machine only. Multi-device or team sync requires a Supabase backend.
- **Embedding quality varies by provider.** Gemini `text-embedding-004` and OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` produce high-quality 768-dim vectors. Ollama embeddings (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`) are usable but may reduce retrieval accuracy.
- **Dashboard is HTTP-only.** The Mind Palace dashboard at `localhost:3000` does not support HTTPS. For remote access, use a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) or SSH tunnel. Basic auth is available via `PRISM_DASHBOARD_USER` / `PRISM_DASHBOARD_PASS`.
- **Long-lived clients can accumulate zombie processes.** MCP clients that run for extended periods (e.g., Claude CLI) may leave orphaned Prism server processes. The lifecycle manager detects true orphans (PPID=1) but allows coexistence for active parent processes. Use `PRISM_INSTANCE` to isolate instances across clients.
- **Migration is one-way.** Universal History Migration imports sessions *into* Prism but does not export back to Claude/Gemini/OpenAI formats. Use `session_export_memory` for portable JSON/Markdown export.
- **No Windows CI testing.** Prism is developed and tested on macOS/Linux. It should work on Windows via Node.js, but edge cases (file paths, PID locks) may surface.
