## What's New in v4.0.0 — Behavioral Memory 🧠

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Active Behavioral Memory** | New `session_save_experience` tool — agents log actions, outcomes, corrections, and confidence scores. Prism tracks importance, applies decay over time, and injects behavioral warnings into context loading so agents learn from past mistakes. |
| 🎯 **Dynamic Role Resolution** | Role parameter is now fully optional across all tools. The server auto-resolves from dashboard settings via `getSetting("default_role")` — set your role once in the Mind Palace Dashboard, and it applies everywhere. No more hardcoding `role: "global"`. |
| 📏 **Token Budget** | New `max_tokens` parameter on `session_load_context` — set a token budget and the response is intelligently truncated to fit. Uses a 1 token ≈ 4 chars heuristic. |
| 📉 **Importance Decay** | Stale behavioral experiences automatically decay over time — older corrections fade in importance to keep context fresh and relevant. |
| 🔧 **Claude Code Hooks** | Refined SessionStart/Stop hook samples that reliably trigger MCP tool calls. Simplified from multi-step workflows to single imperative instructions. |

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v3.1.0 — Memory Lifecycle 🔄</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 📊 **Memory Analytics** | New **Memory Analytics** card in the dashboard — 14-day sparkline chart, active sessions count, rollup savings, and average context richness. Powered by `getAnalytics()` on both SQLite and Supabase backends. |
| ⏳ **Automated Data Retention (TTL)** | Set a per-project data retention policy via `knowledge_set_retention` MCP tool or the dashboard **Lifecycle Controls** card. Entries older than the TTL are soft-deleted (GDPR-compliant `archived_at` tombstone) every 12 hours automatically. Rollups are never expired. Minimum 7 days to prevent accidental mass-delete. |
| 🗜️ **Smart Auto-Compaction** | After every `session_save_ledger`, Prism runs a background health check and triggers compaction automatically if the brain is degraded or unhealthy — gated by `compaction_auto` setting and debounced per-project to prevent concurrent Gemini calls. **Compact Now** button also available in the dashboard. |
| 📦 **PKM Export (Obsidian / Logseq)** | Export any project's full memory as a ZIP archive of Markdown files — one file per session with YAML-like frontmatter, TODOs, decisions, files-changed, and `#hashtag` keywords. Includes an `_index.md` with `[[wikilink]]` references. Click **Export ZIP** in the dashboard Lifecycle Controls card. |
| 🧪 **Expanded Test Suite** | 37 new Vitest tests (95 total) — covers analytics queries, TTL soft-delete idempotency, rollup preservation, `activeCompactions` Set memory-leak prevention, type guards, export Markdown structure, and TTL sweep scheduler contracts. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v3.0.1 — Agent Identity & Brain Clean-up 🧹</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧹 **Brain Health Clean-up** | New **Fix Issues** button in the Mind Palace Dashboard's Brain Health card — detects orphaned handoffs, missing embeddings, and stale rollups, then cleans them up in one click without needing the MCP tool. |
| 👤 **Agent Identity Settings** | Dashboard Settings → Agent Identity panel lets you set a **Default Role** (`dev`, `qa`, `pm`…) and **Agent Name** (e.g. `Dmitri`). Both values auto-apply as fallbacks in all memory and Hivemind tools — no need to pass them per call. |
| 📜 **Role-Scoped Skills** | Each agent role can have its own persistent skill/rules document stored in the dashboard (⚙️ Settings → Skills). It is automatically injected into every `session_load_context` response so the agent boots with its rules pre-loaded. |
| 🔤 **Resource Formatting Fix** | `memory://{project}/handoff` resources now render as formatted plain text (Last Summary, TODOs, Keywords) instead of a raw JSON blob — readable in Claude Desktop's paperclip attach panel. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v3.0.0 — Agent Hivemind 🐝</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🐝 **Role-Scoped Memory** | Optional `role` parameter on ledger, handoff, and context loading — each agent role (dev, qa, pm, lead, security, ux) gets its own isolated memory lane within a project. Defaults to `'global'` for full backward compatibility. |
| 👥 **Agent Registry** | New `agent_register`, `agent_heartbeat`, `agent_list_team` tools — agents announce their presence, pulse their status, and discover who else is working on the team. Stale agents are auto-pruned after 30 minutes. |
| 🎯 **Team Roster Injection** | When loading context with a role, Prism automatically injects a "Team Roster" showing active teammates, their roles, current tasks, and last heartbeat — true multi-agent awareness without extra tool calls. |
| ⚙️ **Dashboard Settings** | New Settings modal with runtime toggles (auto-capture, theme, context depth) backed by a persistent `system_settings` key-value store. Environment variables override DB settings for safety. |
| 📡 **Hivemind Radar** | New dashboard widget showing active agents, their roles (with icons), current tasks, and heartbeat timestamps — a real-time team coordination dashboard. |
| 🔒 **Conditional Tool Registration** | `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND` env var gates Hivemind tools — users who don't need multi-agent features keep the same lean tool count as v2.x. |
| ✅ **Test Suite** | 58 tests across 4 suites (storage, tools, dashboard, load) with Vitest — includes concurrent write stress tests, role isolation verification, and 0.2ms/write performance benchmarks. |

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.5.0 — Enterprise Memory 🏗️</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Memory Tracing (Phase 1)** | Every search now returns a structured `MemoryTrace` with latency breakdown (`embedding_ms`, `storage_ms`, `total_ms`), search strategy, and scoring metadata — surfaced as a separate `content[1]` block for LangSmith integration. |
| 🛡️ **GDPR Memory Deletion (Phase 2)** | New `session_forget_memory` tool with soft-delete (tombstoning via `deleted_at`) and hard-delete. Ownership guards prevent cross-user deletion. `deleted_reason` column captures GDPR Article 17 justification. Top-K Hole solved by filtering inside SQL, not post-query (ensures we always return exactly K results, rather than returning fewer because deleted items were filtered out after the vector search). |
| 🔗 **LangChain Integration (Phase 3)** | `PrismMemoryRetriever` and `PrismKnowledgeRetriever` — async-first `BaseRetriever` subclasses that wrap Prism MCP's traced search endpoints. Trace metadata flows automatically into `Document.metadata["trace"]` for LangSmith visibility. |
| 🧩 **LangGraph Research Agent** | Full example in `examples/langgraph-agent/` — a 5-node agentic research loop with MCP bridge, persistent memory, and `EnsembleRetriever` hybrid search. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.5.1 — Version Sync & Embedding Safety</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔄 **Dynamic Versioning** | Server version is now derived from `package.json` at startup — MCP handshake, dashboard badge, and npm metadata always stay in sync. Falls back to `0.0.0` if unreadable. |
| 🛡️ **Embedding Dimension Validation** | `generateEmbedding()` now validates the returned vector is exactly 768 dimensions at runtime, catching model regressions before storing bad vectors. Removed `as any` cast in favor of proper `EmbedContentRequest` typing. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.3.12 — Stability & Fixes</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🪲 **Windows Black Screen Fix** | Fixed Python `subprocess.Popen` spawning visible Node.js terminal windows on Windows. |
| 📝 **Debug Logging** | Gated verbose startup logs behind `PRISM_DEBUG_LOGGING` for a cleaner default experience. |
| ⚡ **Excess Loading Fixes** | Performance improvements to resolve excess loading loops. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.3.8 — LangGraph Research Agent</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🤖 **LangGraph Research Agent** | New `examples/langgraph-agent/` — a 5-node agentic research agent (plan→search→analyze→decide→answer→save) with autonomous looping, MCP integration, and persistent memory. |
| 🧠 **Agentic Memory** | `save_session` node persists research findings to a ledger — the agent doesn't just answer and forget. Routes to Prism's `session_save_ledger` in MCP-connected mode. |
| 🔌 **MCP Client Bridge** | Raw JSON-RPC 2.0 client (`mcp_client.py`) for Python 3.9+ — dynamically discovers and wraps Prism MCP tools as LangChain `StructuredTool` objects. |
| 🔧 **Storage Abstraction Fix** | Resource/Prompt handlers now route through `getStorage()` instead of calling Supabase directly — eliminates EOF crashes when reading `memory://` resources. |
| 🛡️ **Error Boundaries** | Resource handlers catch errors gracefully and return proper MCP error responses (`isError: true`) instead of crashing the server process. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.2.0</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🩺 **Brain Health Check** | `session_health_check` — like Unix `fsck` for your agent's memory. Detects missing embeddings, duplicate entries, orphaned handoffs, and stale rollups. Use `auto_fix: true` to repair automatically. |
| 📊 **Mind Palace Health** | Brain health indicator on the Mind Palace Dashboard — see your memory integrity at a glance. **🧹 Fix Issues** button auto-deletes orphaned handoffs in one click. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in v2.0 "Mind Palace"</strong></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🏠 **Local-First SQLite** | Run Prism entirely locally with zero cloud dependencies. Full vector search (libSQL F32_BLOB) and FTS5 included. |
| 🔮 **Mind Palace UI** | A beautiful glassmorphism dashboard at `localhost:3000` to inspect your agent's memory, visual vault, and Git drift. |
| 🕰️ **Time Travel** | `memory_history` and `memory_checkout` act like `git revert` for your agent's brain — full version history with OCC. |
| 🖼️ **Visual Memory** | Agents can save screenshots to a local media vault. Auto-capture mode snapshots your local dev server on every handoff save. |
| 📡 **Agent Telepathy** | Multi-client sync: if your agent in Cursor saves state, Claude Desktop gets a live notification instantly. |
| 🌅 **Morning Briefing** | Gemini auto-synthesizes a 3-bullet action plan if it's been >4 hours since your last session. |
| 📝 **Code Mode Templates** | 8 pre-built QuickJS extraction templates for GitHub, Jira, OpenAPI, Slack, CSV, and DOM parsing — zero reasoning tokens. |
| 🔍 **Reality Drift Detection** | Prism captures Git state on save and warns if files changed outside the agent's view. |

</details>

---

## Quick Start (Zero Config — Local Mode)

Get the MCP server running with Claude Desktop or Cursor in **under 60 seconds**. No API keys required for basic local memory!

### Option A: npx (Fastest)

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it — **zero env vars needed** for local memory, Mind Palace dashboard, Time Travel, and Telepathy.

> **Optional API keys:** Add `BRAVE_API_KEY` for web search, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for semantic search + Morning Briefings + paper analysis. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full list.

### Option B: Cloud Sync Mode (Supabase)

To share memory across multiple machines or teams, switch to Supabase:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PRISM_STORAGE": "supabase",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "your-supabase-anon-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option C: Clone & Build (Full Control)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp.git
cd prism-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/prism-mcp/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-api-key",
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-google-gemini-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart your MCP client. That's it — all tools are now available.**

## 🔮 The Mind Palace Dashboard

Prism MCP spins up a lightweight, zero-dependency HTTP server alongside the MCP stdio process. No frameworks, no build step — just pure glassmorphism CSS served as a template literal.

Open **`http://localhost:3000`** in your browser to see exactly what your AI agent is thinking:

![Mind Palace Dashboard](docs/mind-palace-dashboard.png)

- **Current State & TODOs** — See the exact context injected into the LLM's prompt
- **Agent Identity Chip** — Header shows your active role + name (e.g. `🛠️ dev · Antigravity`); click to open Settings
- **Brain Health 🩺** — Memory integrity status at a glance; **🧹 Fix Issues** button auto-cleans orphaned handoffs in one click
- **Git Drift Detection** — Alerts you if you've modified code outside the agent's view
- **Morning Briefing** — AI-synthesized action plan from your last sessions
- **Time Travel Timeline** — Browse historical handoff states and revert any version
- **Visual Memory Vault** — Browse UI screenshots and auto-captured HTML states
- **Session Ledger** — Full audit trail of every decision your agent has made
- **Neural Graph** — Force-directed visualization of project ↔ keyword associations

## Claude Code Integration (Hooks)

Claude Code supports **lifecycle hooks** in `~/.claude/settings.json` that fire automatically at session start and end. Use these to auto-hydrate and persist Prism memory without manual prompting.

### SessionStart Hook

Automatically loads context when a new session begins:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import json; print(json.dumps({'continue': True, 'suppressOutput': False, 'systemMessage': 'You MUST call mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context twice before responding to the user: first with project=my-project level=standard, then with project=my-other-project level=standard. Do not skip this.'}))\"",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Stop Hook

Automatically saves session memory when a session ends:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import json; print(json.dumps({'continue': True, 'suppressOutput': False, 'systemMessage': 'MANDATORY END WORKFLOW: 1) Call mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger with project and summary. 2) Call mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff with expected_version set to the loaded version.'}))\"",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### How the Hooks Work

The hook `command` runs a Python one-liner that returns a JSON object to Claude Code:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `continue: true` | Tell Claude Code to proceed (don't abort the session) |
| `suppressOutput: false` | Show the hook result to the agent |
| `systemMessage` | Instruction injected as a system message — the agent follows it |

The agent receives the `systemMessage` as an instruction and executes the tool calls. The server resolves the agent's **role** and **name** automatically from the dashboard — no need to specify them in the hook.

### Role Resolution — No Hardcoding Needed

Prism resolves the agent role dynamically using a priority chain:

```
explicit tool argument  →  dashboard setting  →  "global" (default)
```

1. **Explicit arg wins** — if `role` is passed in the tool call, it's used directly.
2. **Dashboard fallback** — if `role` is omitted, the server calls `getSetting("default_role")` and uses whatever role you configured in the **Mind Palace Dashboard ⚙️ Settings → Agent Identity**.
3. **Final default** — if no dashboard setting exists, falls back to `"global"`.

Change your role once in the dashboard, and it automatically applies to every session — CLI, extension, and all MCP clients.

### Verification

If hydration ran successfully, the agent's output will include:
- A `[👤 AGENT IDENTITY]` block showing your dashboard-configured role and name
- `PRISM_CONTEXT_LOADED` marker text

If the marker is missing, the hook did not fire or the MCP server is not connected.

---

## Gemini / Antigravity Integration

Gemini-based clients (like Antigravity) use `GEMINI.md` global rules or user rules for startup behavior. The server resolves the role from the dashboard automatically.

### Global Rules (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`)

```markdown
## Prism MCP Memory Auto-Load (CRITICAL)
At the start of every new session, call `mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context`
for these projects:
- `my-project` (level=standard)
- `my-other-project` (level=standard)

After both succeed, print PRISM_CONTEXT_LOADED.
```

### User Rules (Antigravity Settings)

If your Gemini client supports user rules, add the same instructions there. The key points:

1. **Call `session_load_context` as a tool** — not `read_resource`. Only the tool returns the `[👤 AGENT IDENTITY]` block.
2. **Verify** — confirm the response includes `version` and `last_summary`.

### Session End

At the end of each session, save state:

```markdown
## Session End Protocol
1) Call `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger` with project and summary.
2) Call `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff` with expected_version from the loaded version.
```

---

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How Prism MCP Helps |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Long-running feature work** | Save session state at end of day, restore full context the next morning — no re-explaining |
| **Multi-agent collaboration** | Telepathy sync lets multiple agents share context in real time |
| **Consulting / multi-project** | Switch between client projects with progressive context loading |
| **Research & analysis** | Multi-engine search with 94% context reduction via sandboxed code transforms |
| **Team onboarding** | New team member's agent loads full project history via `session_load_context("deep")` |
| **Visual debugging** | Save screenshots of broken UI to visual memory — the agent remembers what it looked like |
| **Offline / air-gapped** | Full SQLite local mode with no internet dependency for memory features |

## Agent Hivemind — Role Usage

Role-scoped memory lets multiple agents work on the same project without stepping on each other's memory. Each role gets its own isolated memory lane. Defaults to `global` for full backward compatibility.

### Available Roles

| Role | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `dev` | Development agent |
| `qa` | Testing / QA agent |
| `pm` | Product management |
| `lead` | Tech lead / orchestrator |
| `security` | Security review |
| `ux` | Design / UX |
| `global` | Default — shared, no isolation |

Custom role strings are also supported (e.g. `"docs"`, `"ml"`).

### Using Roles with Memory Tools

Just add `"role"` to any of the core memory tools:

```json
// Save a ledger entry as the "dev" agent
{ "name": "session_save_ledger", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "role": "dev",
  "conversation_id": "abc123",
  "summary": "Fixed the auth race condition"
}}

// Load context scoped to your role
// Also injects a Team Roster showing active teammates
{ "name": "session_load_context", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "role": "dev",
  "level": "standard"
}}

// Save handoff as the "qa" agent
{ "name": "session_save_handoff", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "role": "qa",
  "last_summary": "Ran regression suite — 2 failures in auth module"
}}
```

### Hivemind Coordination Tools

> **Requires:** `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND=true` (Boot Setting — restart required)

```json
// Announce yourself to the team at session start
{ "name": "agent_register", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "role": "dev",
  "agent_name": "Dev Agent #1",
  "current_task": "Refactoring auth module"
}}

// Pulse every ~5 min to stay visible (agents pruned after 30 min)
{ "name": "agent_heartbeat", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "role": "dev",
  "current_task": "Now writing tests"
}}

// See everyone on the team
{ "name": "agent_list_team", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app"
}}
```

### How Role Isolation Works

- `session_load_context` with `role: "dev"` only sees entries saved with `role: "dev"`
- The `global` role is a shared pool — anything saved without a role goes here
- When loading *with* a role, Prism auto-injects a **Team Roster** block listing active teammates, roles, and tasks — no extra tool call needed
- The Hivemind Radar widget in the Mind Palace dashboard shows agent activity in real time

### Setting Your Agent Identity

The easiest way to configure your role and name is via the **Mind Palace Dashboard ⚙️ Settings → Agent Identity**:

- **Default Role** — dropdown to select `dev`, `qa`, `pm`, `lead`, `security`, `ux`, or `global`
- **Agent Name** — free text for your display name (e.g. `Dmitri`, `Dev Alex`, `QA Bot`)

Once set, **all memory and Hivemind tools automatically use these values** as fallbacks — no need to pass `role` or `agent_name` in every tool call.

> **Priority order:** explicit tool arg → dashboard setting → `"global"` (default)

**Alternative — hardcode in your startup rules** (if you prefer prompt-level config):

```markdown
## Prism MCP Memory Auto-Load (CRITICAL)
At the start of every new session, call session_load_context with:
- project: "my-app", role: "dev"
- project: "my-other-project", role: "dev"
```

> **Tip:** For true multi-agent setups, each AI instance has its own Mind Palace dashboard — set a different identity per agent there rather than managing it in prompts.

---

## LangChain / LangGraph Integration

Prism MCP includes first-class Python adapters for the LangChain ecosystem, located in `examples/langgraph-agent/`:

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **MCP Bridge** | `mcp_client.py` | JSON-RPC 2.0 client with `call_tool()` and `call_tool_raw()` (preserves `MemoryTrace`) |
| **Semantic Retriever** | `prism_retriever.py` | `PrismMemoryRetriever(BaseRetriever)` — async-first vector search |
| **Keyword Retriever** | `prism_retriever.py` | `PrismKnowledgeRetriever(BaseRetriever)` — FTS5 keyword search |
| **Forget Tool** | `tools.py` | `forget_memory()` — GDPR deletion bridge |
| **Research Agent** | `agent.py` | 5-node LangGraph agent (plan→search→analyze→decide→answer→save) |

### Hybrid Search with EnsembleRetriever

Combine both retrievers for hybrid (semantic + keyword) search with a single line:

```python
from langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever
from prism_retriever import PrismMemoryRetriever, PrismKnowledgeRetriever

retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[PrismMemoryRetriever(...), PrismKnowledgeRetriever(...)],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3],  # 70% semantic, 30% keyword
)
```

### MemoryTrace in LangSmith

When `enable_trace=True`, each `Document.metadata["trace"]` contains:

```json
{
  "strategy": "vector_cosine_similarity",
  "latency": { "embedding_ms": 45, "storage_ms": 12, "total_ms": 57 },
  "result_count": 5,
  "threshold": 0.7
}
```

This metadata flows automatically into LangSmith traces for observability.

### Async Architecture

The retrievers use `_aget_relevant_documents` as the primary path with `asyncio.to_thread()` to wrap the synchronous MCP bridge. This prevents the `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` crash that plagues most LangGraph deployments.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | No | Brave Search Pro API key (enables web/local search tools) |
| `PRISM_STORAGE` | No | `"local"` (default) or `"supabase"` — **requires restart** |
| `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND` | No | Set `"true"` to enable multi-agent Hivemind tools — **requires restart** |

---

## ⚡ Boot Settings (Restart Required)

Some settings affect how Prism **initializes at startup** and cannot be changed at runtime. Prism stores these in a lightweight, dedicated SQLite database (`~/.prism-mcp/prism-config.db`) that is read **before** the main storage backend is selected — solving the chicken-and-egg problem of needing config before the config store is ready.

> **⚠️ You must restart the Prism MCP server after changing any Boot Setting.** The Mind Palace dashboard labels these with a **"Restart Required"** badge.

| Setting | Dashboard Control | Environment Override | Description |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `PRISM_STORAGE` | ⚙️ Storage Backend dropdown | `PRISM_STORAGE=supabase` | Switch between `local` (SQLite) and `supabase` (cloud) |
| `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND` | ⚙️ Hivemind Mode toggle | `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND=true` | Enable/disable multi-agent coordination tools |

### How Boot Settings Work

1. **Dashboard saves the setting** → written to `~/.prism-mcp/prism-config.db` immediately
2. **You restart the MCP server** → server reads the config DB at startup, selects backend/features
3. **Environment variables always win** → if `PRISM_STORAGE` is set in your MCP config JSON, it overrides the dashboard value

```
Priority: env var in MCP config JSON  >  Dashboard (prism-config.db)  >  default (local)
```

### Runtime Settings (no restart needed)

These settings take effect immediately without a restart:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dashboard Theme | Visual theme for the Mind Palace (`dark`, `midnight`, `purple`) |
| Context Depth | Default level for `session_load_context` (`quick`, `standard`, `deep`) |
| Auto-Capture HTML | Snapshot local dev server HTML on every handoff save |

---

## Progressive Context Loading

Load only what you need — saves tokens and speeds up boot:

| Level | What You Get | Size | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **quick** | Open TODOs + keywords | ~50 tokens | Fast check-in: "what was I working on?" |
| **standard** | Above + summary + recent decisions + knowledge cache + Git drift | ~200 tokens | **Recommended default** |
| **deep** | Above + full logs (last 5 sessions) + cross-project knowledge | ~1000+ tokens | After a long break or when you need complete history |

### Morning Briefing (Automatic)

If it's been more than 4 hours since your last session, Prism automatically:
1. Fetches the 10 most recent uncompacted ledger entries
2. Sends a notification: *"🌅 Brewing your Morning Briefing..."*
3. Uses Gemini to synthesize a 3-bullet action plan
4. Injects the briefing into the `session_load_context` response

The agent boots up knowing exactly what to do — zero prompting needed.

### Auto-Load on Session Start (Recommended)

For the best experience, configure your AI coding assistant to **automatically call `session_load_context`** at the start of every new session. This ensures your agent always boots with full project memory — no manual prompting needed.

See the full setup guides for each client:
- **[Claude Code Integration (Hooks)](#claude-code-integration-hooks)** — `SessionStart` and `Stop` hook JSON samples for `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **[Gemini / Antigravity Integration](#gemini--antigravity-integration)** — global rules for `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` or user rules

> **Key principle:** Never hardcode a `role` in your hooks or rules. Set your role once in the **Mind Palace Dashboard ⚙️ Settings → Agent Identity**, and Prism automatically resolves it for every tool call across all clients. See [Role Resolution](#role-resolution--no-hardcoding-needed).

> **Tip:** Replace `my-project` with your actual project identifiers. You can list as many projects as you need — each one gets its own independent memory timeline.

---

## Time Travel (Version History)

Every successful handoff save creates a snapshot. You can browse and revert any version:

```
v1 → v2 → v3 → v4 (current)
              ↑
        memory_checkout(v2) → creates v5 with v2's content
```

This is a **non-destructive revert** — like `git revert`, not `git reset`. No history is ever lost.

### Usage

```json
// Browse all versions
{ "name": "memory_history", "arguments": { "project": "my-app" } }

// Revert to version 2
{ "name": "memory_checkout", "arguments": { "project": "my-app", "version": 2 } }
```

---

## Agent Telepathy (Multi-Client Sync)

When Agent A (Cursor) saves a handoff, Agent B (Claude Desktop) gets notified instantly:

- **Local Mode:** File-based IPC via SQLite polling
- **Cloud Mode:** Supabase Realtime (Postgres CDC)

No configuration needed — it just works.

---

## Reality Drift Detection

Prism captures Git state (branch + commit SHA) on every handoff save. When the agent loads context, it compares the saved state against the current working directory:

```
⚠️ REALITY DRIFT DETECTED for "my-app":
  Branch changed: feature/auth → main
  Commit changed: abc1234 → def5678
  
  The codebase has been modified since your last session.
  Re-examine before making assumptions.
```

This prevents the agent from writing code based on stale context.

---

## Visual Memory & Auto-Capture

### Manual: Save Screenshots

```json
{ "name": "session_save_image", "arguments": {
  "project": "my-app",
  "image_path": "/path/to/screenshot.png",
  "description": "Login page after CSS fix"
}}
```

### Automatic: HTML Snapshots

Set `PRISM_AUTO_CAPTURE=true` and Prism silently captures your local dev server's HTML on every handoff save. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF, SVG, HTML.

---

## Knowledge Accumulation

Every `session_save_ledger` and `session_save_handoff` automatically extracts keywords using lightweight, in-process NLP (~0.020ms/call). No LLM calls, no external dependencies.

**Example:** Saving *"Fixed Stripe webhook race condition using database-backed idempotency keys"* auto-extracts:
- **Keywords:** `stripe`, `webhook`, `race`, `condition`, `database`, `idempotency`
- **Categories:** `cat:debugging`, `cat:api-integration`

### Search Knowledge

```json
{ "name": "knowledge_search", "arguments": {
  "project": "ecommerce-api",
  "category": "debugging",
  "query": "Stripe webhook"
}}
```

### Forget Bad Memories

| Mode | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **By project** | `project: "old-app"` | Clear all knowledge |
| **By category** | `category: "debugging"` | Forget debugging entries only |
| **By age** | `older_than_days: 30` | Forget entries older than 30 days |
| **Dry run** | `dry_run: true` | Preview what would be deleted |

## GDPR Compliance

### GDPR-Compliant Deletion

Prism supports surgical, per-entry deletion for GDPR Article 17 compliance:

```json
// Soft delete (tombstone — reversible, keeps audit trail)
{ "name": "session_forget_memory", "arguments": {
  "memory_id": "abc123",
  "reason": "User requested data deletion"
}}

// Hard delete (permanent — irreversible)
{ "name": "session_forget_memory", "arguments": {
  "memory_id": "abc123",
  "hard_delete": true
}}
```

**How it works:**
- **Soft delete** sets `deleted_at = NOW()` + `deleted_reason`. The entry stays in the DB for audit but is excluded from ALL search results (vector, FTS5, and context loading).
- **Hard delete** physically removes the row. FTS5 triggers auto-clean the full-text index.
- **Top-K Hole Prevention**: `deleted_at IS NULL` filtering happens INSIDE the SQL query, BEFORE the `LIMIT` clause — so `LIMIT 5` always returns 5 live results, never fewer. *(A "Top-K Hole" occurs when deleted entries are filtered out after the vector search, causing fewer than K results to be returned. Prism avoids this by filtering inside SQL before the LIMIT.)*

### Article 17 — Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

| Requirement | How Prism Satisfies It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Individual deletion** | `session_forget_memory` operates on a single `memory_id` — the data subject can request deletion of *specific* memories, not just bulk wipes. |
| **Soft delete (audit trail)** | `deleted_at` + `deleted_reason` columns prove *when* and *why* data was deleted — required for SOC2 audit logs. |
| **Hard delete (full erasure)** | `hard_delete: true` physically removes the row from the database. No tombstone, no trace. True erasure as required by Article 17(1). |
| **Justification logging** | The `reason` parameter captures the GDPR justification (e.g., `"User requested data deletion"`, `"Data retention policy expired"`). |

### Article 25 — Data Protection by Design and by Default

| Requirement | How Prism Satisfies It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Ownership guards** | `softDeleteLedger()` and `hardDeleteLedger()` verify `user_id` before executing. User A cannot delete User B's data. |
| **Database-level filtering** | `deleted_at IS NULL` is inside the SQL `WHERE` clause, *before* `LIMIT`. Soft-deleted data never leaks into search results — not even accidentally. |
| **Default = safe** | The system defaults to soft delete (reversible). Hard delete requires an explicit `hard_delete: true` flag — preventing accidental permanent data loss. |
| **Multi-tenant isolation** | `PRISM_USER_ID` environment variable ensures all operations are scoped to a single tenant. |

### Coverage Summary

| GDPR Right | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Right to Erasure (Art. 17) | ✅ Implemented | `session_forget_memory` (soft + hard delete) |
| Data Protection by Design (Art. 25) | ✅ Implemented | Ownership guards, DB-level filtering, safe defaults |
| Audit Trail | ✅ Implemented | `deleted_at` + `deleted_reason` columns |
| User Isolation | ✅ Implemented | `user_id` verification on all delete operations |
| Right to Portability (Art. 20) | ⬜ Roadmap | `session_export_memory` (planned) |
| Consent Management | ➖ Out of scope | Application-layer responsibility |

> **Note:** No software is "GDPR certified" on its own — GDPR is an organizational compliance framework. Prism provides the technical controls that a DPO (Data Protection Officer) needs to satisfy the data deletion and privacy-by-design requirements.

## Observability & Tracing

Prism MCP includes a custom **MemoryTrace** engine that provides per-query observability for every memory operation. This is not the OpenTelemetry SDK — it's a lightweight, zero-dependency tracing system purpose-built for MCP.

### What MemoryTrace Provides

| Capability | MemoryTrace | Full OpenTelemetry SDK |
|------------|:-----------:|:----------------------:|
| Per-query latency breakdown (`embedding_ms`, `storage_ms`, `total_ms`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search strategy attribution (`semantic`, `keyword`, `hybrid`) | ✅ | ❌ (custom) |
| Result scoring metadata | ✅ | ❌ (custom) |
| LangSmith integration (via retriever metadata) | ✅ | ✅ |
| W3C `traceparent` / distributed trace context | ❌ | ✅ |
| Export to Jaeger / Zipkin / Datadog | ❌ | ✅ |
| Auto-instrumentation of HTTP / DB calls | ❌ | ✅ |
| External SDK dependency | **None** | `@opentelemetry/sdk-*` |

### Example MemoryTrace Output

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "{\"trace\":{\"strategy\":\"semantic\",\"latency\":{\"embedding_ms\":45,\"storage_ms\":12,\"total_ms\":57},\"result_count\":3,\"threshold\":0.7}}"
}
```

Traces are returned as `content[1]` in MCP responses — a separate content block that keeps structured telemetry out of the LLM's context window while making it available to orchestration layers like LangSmith.

### Roadmap

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| MemoryTrace (current) | ✅ Shipped |
| OpenTelemetry SDK integration | ⬜ Planned |
| Span export to Jaeger/Zipkin | ⬜ Planned |
| W3C Trace Context propagation | ⬜ Planned |

## Supabase Setup (Cloud Mode)

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step Supabase configuration</strong></summary>

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in (free tier works)
2. Click **New Project** → choose a name and password → select a region
3. Wait for provisioning (~30 seconds)

### 2. Apply Migrations

In the SQL Editor, run:
1. [`supabase/migrations/015_session_memory.sql`](supabase/migrations/015_session_memory.sql)
2. [`supabase/migrations/016_knowledge_accumulation.sql`](supabase/migrations/016_knowledge_accumulation.sql)

### 3. Get Credentials

Go to **Settings → API** and copy:
- **Project URL** (e.g. `https://abcdefg.supabase.co`)
- **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 4. Configure

Add these to your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` under `"env"`), or export them if running the server manually:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
export PRISM_STORAGE="supabase"
```

> **Note:** Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients spawn isolated processes — terminal `export` commands won't be inherited. Always set env vars in the client's config JSON.

### Security

1. **Use the anon key** for MCP server config
2. **Enable RLS** on both tables
3. **Never commit** your `SUPABASE_KEY` to version control

## 🚀 Roadmap

> **[View the full project board →](https://github.com/users/dcostenco/projects/1/views/1)**

### ✅ v3.0.1 — Agent Identity & Brain Clean-up (Shipped!)

See [What's New in v3.0.1](#whats-new-in-v301---agent-identity--brain-clean-up-) above.

### ✅ v3.0 — Agent Hivemind (Shipped!)

See [What's New in v3.0.0 — Agent Hivemind](#whats-new-in-v300---agent-hivemind-) above.

### 🔜 v4.0 — Active Behavioral Memory (In Development)

Evolves Prism from passive session logging to an **experience learning engine** that shapes agent behavior over time.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structured Event Types** | Typed experience events (`correction`, `success`, `failure`, `learning`) with `confidence_score` (1-100) — agents don't just log, they learn |
| **Token-Budgeted Context Loading** | `max_tokens` param on `session_load_context` — guarantees constant cost regardless of DB size (1 token ≈ 4 chars heuristic) |
| **`session_save_experience` Tool** | Dedicated tool for behavioral data: context → action → outcome → correction. Auto-extracts keywords, seeds importance |
| **Insight Graduation System** | `knowledge_upvote` / `knowledge_downvote` tools. Importance ≥ 7 → graduated rule. 30-day decay prevents bloat |
| **Behavioral Warnings** | High-importance corrections auto-surface as `[⚠️ BEHAVIORAL WARNINGS]` in `session_load_context` — agents proactively avoid past mistakes |

### 🚀 Future Ideas

| Feature | Issue | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Role-Scoped Skills & Rules** | — | Each agent role (`dev`, `qa`, `pm`, etc.) gets its own persistent skill/rules document. Preloaded automatically at session start via `session_load_context`. Skills editable and uploadable from the Mind Palace Dashboard (⚙️ → Skills tab per role). Stored in `configStorage` per-role key — backend already exists. |
| OpenTelemetry SDK Integration | [#6](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/6) | W3C-compliant tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin export |
| GDPR Right to Portability | [#7](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/7) | `session_export_memory` tool for Art. 20 compliance |
| Multi-agent CRDT Conflict Resolution | [#9](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/9) | Conflict-free replicated data types for concurrent agent edits |
| Memory Analytics Dashboard | [#10](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/10) | Usage trends, token costs, and memory health metrics |
| Pluggable LLM Providers | [#13](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/13) | Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama provider adapters |
| VLM / OCR for Visual Memory | [#14](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/14) | Auto-extract text and insights from stored images |
| Automated Data Retention (TTL) | [#16](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/16) | Time-based memory expiration policies |
| Obsidian / Logseq Export Bridge | [#17](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/17) | Export memory to Markdown knowledge bases |
| Interactive Knowledge Graph Editor | [#19](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/19) | Visual graph editor inside the Mind Palace dashboard |

### 🧰 Infrastructure & Stack

| Feature | Issue | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Supabase RPC Soft-Delete Filtering | [#8](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/8) | Server-side RPC filtering for GDPR-deleted records |
| Pluggable Embedding Providers | [#11](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/11) | Swap Gemini for OpenAI, Cohere, or local models |
| Automated Test Suite | [#12](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/12) | Unit, integration, and E2E test coverage with CI/CD |
| Mind Palace Auth & Secure Access | [#15](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/15) | Authentication for the dashboard when exposed remotely |
| TypeScript LangGraph & Vercel AI SDK Examples | [#18](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp/issues/18) | Reference implementations for popular frameworks |
