# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **CRDT Handoff Merging**: Replaced strict OCC rejection with automatic conflict-free multi-agent state merging. When two agents save concurrently, Prism now auto-merges instead of rejecting.
  - Custom OR-Map engine (`crdtMerge.ts`): Add-Wins OR-Set for arrays (`open_todos`), Last-Writer-Wins for scalars (`last_summary`, `key_context`).
  - 3-way merge with `getHandoffAtVersion()` base retrieval from SQLite and Supabase.
  - `disable_merge` bypass parameter for strict OCC when needed.
  - `totalCrdtMerges` tracked in health stats and dashboard.
- **Background Purge Scheduler**: Unified automated maintenance system that replaces all manual storage management.
  - Single `setInterval` loop (default: 12 hours, configurable via `PRISM_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS`).
  - 4 maintenance tasks: TTL sweep, Ebbinghaus importance decay, auto-compaction, deep storage purge.
  - Dashboard status card with last sweep timestamp, duration, and per-task results.
  - `PRISM_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` env var (default: `true`).
- **Autonomous Web Scholar**: Agent-driven background research pipeline.
  - Brave Search → Firecrawl scrape → LLM synthesis → Prism ledger injection.
  - Task-aware topic selection: biases research toward active Hivemind agent tasks.
  - Reentrancy guard prevents concurrent pipeline runs.
  - 15K character content cap per scraped article for cost control.
  - Configurable: `PRISM_SCHOLAR_ENABLED`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_INTERVAL_MS`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_TOPICS`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_MAX_ARTICLES_PER_RUN`.
- **Scholar ↔ Hivemind Integration**: Scholar registers as `scholar` role agent with lifecycle heartbeats at each pipeline stage. Telepathy broadcast fires on completion to notify active agents. Task-aware topic selection biases research toward topics matching active agent tasks.
- **Updated Architecture Documentation**: 3 new sections in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` covering Agent Hivemind, Background Scheduler, and Web Scholar with mermaid diagrams.

### Architecture
- New module: `src/scholar/webScholar.ts` — 281 lines, full pipeline with Hivemind integration.
- New module: `src/crdtMerge.ts` — OR-Map engine with 3-way merge algorithm.
- Extended: `src/backgroundScheduler.ts` — unified maintenance + Scholar scheduling.
- Storage interface: `getHandoffAtVersion()` for CRDT base retrieval.

### Engineering
- 362 tests across 16 suites (10 new Scholar tests)
- Clean TypeScript build, zero errors
- Backward compatible: all new features are opt-in via env vars

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Hivemind Health Watchdog**: Server-side active monitoring system for multi-agent coordination. Transforms the Hivemind from a passive registry into a self-healing orchestrator.
  - **State Machine**: Agents transition through `ACTIVE → STALE (5m) → FROZEN (15m) → OFFLINE (30m, auto-pruned)` based on heartbeat freshness.
  - **OVERDUE Detection**: Agents can declare `expected_duration_minutes` on heartbeat. If the task exceeds this ETA, the Watchdog flags the agent as OVERDUE.
  - **Loop Detection**: DJB2 hash of `current_task` is computed on every heartbeat. If the same task repeats ≥5 times consecutively, the agent is flagged as LOOPING. Detection runs inline in the heartbeat hot path (~0.01ms overhead).
  - **Telepathy (Alert Injection)**: Watchdog alerts are appended **directly to `result.content[]`** of tool responses, bypassing MCP's `sendLoggingMessage` limitation where LLMs don't read debug logs. This guarantees the LLM reads the alert in its reasoning loop.
  - **Configurable Thresholds**: All thresholds configurable via env vars (`PRISM_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_STALE_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_FROZEN_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_OFFLINE_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_LOOP_THRESHOLD`).
- **`expected_duration_minutes` parameter**: New optional parameter on `agent_heartbeat` tool for task ETA declarations.
- **Health-State Dashboard**: Hivemind Radar now shows color-coded health indicators (🟢/🟡/🔴/⏰/🔄), loop count badges, and auto-refreshes every 15 seconds.
- **`getAllAgents()` / `updateAgentStatus()`**: New storage backend methods for cross-project agent sweeps and whitelist-guarded status transitions.
- **Supabase Migration 032**: `task_start_time`, `expected_duration_minutes`, `task_hash`, `loop_count` columns + user_id index.

### Architecture
- New module: `src/hivemindWatchdog.ts` — 270 lines of pure business logic, zero MCP Server dependency, fully testable in isolation.
- Alert queue: In-memory `Map<string, WatchdogAlert>` with dedup key `project:role:status` — fire-and-forget, no persistence needed.
- Dual-mode alerting: Direct content injection (primary, for LLMs) + `sendLoggingMessage` (secondary, for operators).
- Graceful degradation: All sweep errors are caught and logged, never crash the server. `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND` gate prevents any CPU overhead for single-agent users.

### Engineering
- 10 files changed, ~600 lines added
- Clean TypeScript build, zero errors
- Backward compatible: all new columns have defaults, watchdog is no-op without `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND=true`

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Cognitive Memory — Ebbinghaus Importance Decay**: Entries now have `last_accessed_at` tracking. At retrieval time, `effective_importance = base × 0.95^days` computes a time-decayed relevance score. Frequently accessed memories stay prominent; neglected ones fade naturally.
- **Context-Weighted Retrieval** (`context_boost` parameter): When enabled on `session_search_memory`, the active project's branch, keywords, and context are prepended to the search query before embedding generation — naturally biasing the vector toward contextually relevant results.
- **Smart Consolidation**: Enhanced the `session_compact_ledger` prompt to extract recurring principles and patterns alongside summaries, producing richer rollup entries.
- **Universal History Migration**: Modular migration utility using the Strategy Pattern. Ingest historical sessions from Claude Code (JSONL streaming), Gemini (OOM-safe StreamArray), and OpenAI/ChatGPT (JSON) into the Mind Palace.
  - **Conversation Grouping**: Turns are grouped into logical conversations using a 30-minute time-gap heuristic. A 100MB file with 200 conversations → 200 summary entries (not 50,000 raw turns).
  - **Idempotent Deduplication**: Each conversation gets a deterministic ID. Re-running the same import is a no-op.
  - **Dashboard Import UI**: File picker (📂 Browse) + manual path input, auto-format detection, real-time result display.
  - Features `p-limit(5)` concurrency control and `--dry-run` support.

### Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Added 17-column allowlist to `patchLedger()` in SQLite storage. Dynamic column interpolation now rejects any column not in the allowlist.

### Fixed
- **Supabase DDL v31**: Added missing `last_accessed_at` column migration for Supabase users. Without this, the Ebbinghaus decay logic would have thrown a column-not-found error.
- **context_boost guard**: Now logs a warning and continues gracefully when `context_boost=true` is passed without a `project` parameter, instead of silently failing.
- **Redundant getStorage() call**: Removed duplicate storage initialization in the Ebbinghaus decay block.
- **README dead link**: Fixed `#supabase-setup` anchor (inside `<details>` blocks, GitHub doesn't generate anchors).

### Engineering
- 9 new migration tests (adapter parsing, conversation grouping, dedup, tool keyword preservation)
- 352 tests across 15 suites
- 17 files changed, +1,016 lines

## [5.1.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added
- **Deep Storage Mode**: New `deep_storage_purge` tool to reclaim ~90% of vector storage by dropping float32 vectors for entries with TurboQuant compressed blobs.
- **Knowledge Graph Editor**: Transformed the Mind Palace Neural Graph into an interactive editor with dynamic filtering, node renaming, and surgical keyword deletion.
### Fixed
- **Auto-Load Reliability**: Hardened auto-load prompt instructions and added hook scripts for Claude Code / Antigravity to ensure memory is loaded on the first turn (bypassing model CoT hallucinations).
### Engineering
- 303/303 automated tests passing across 13 suites.

## 🚀 v5.0.0 — The TurboQuant Update (2026-03-26)

**Quantized Agentic Memory is here.**

### ✨ Features

- **10× Storage Reduction:** Integrated Google's TurboQuant algorithm (ICLR 2026) to compress 768-dim embeddings from 3,072 bytes to ~400 bytes. Zero external dependencies — pure TypeScript math core with Householder QR, Lloyd-Max scalar quantization, and QJL residual correction.
- **Two-Tier Search:** Introduced a JS-land asymmetric similarity search fallback (`asymmetricCosineSimilarity`), ensuring semantic search works even without native DB vector extensions (`sqlite-vec` / `pgvector`).
- **Atomic Backfill:** Optimized background workers to repair and compress embeddings in a single atomic database update (`patchLedger`), reducing lock contention for multi-agent Hivemind use cases.
- **Supabase Parity:** Full support for quantized blobs in the cloud backend (migration v29 + `saveLedger` insert).

### 🏗️ Architecture

- New file: `src/utils/turboquant.ts` — 665 lines, zero-dependency math core
- Storage schema: `embedding_compressed` (TEXT/base64), `embedding_format` (turbo3/turbo4/float32), `embedding_turbo_radius` (REAL)
- SQLite migration v5.0 (3 idempotent ALTER TABLE)
- Supabase migration v29 via `prism_apply_ddl` RPC

### 📊 Benchmarks
