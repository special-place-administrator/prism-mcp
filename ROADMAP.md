## 🏆 Shipped — The v4.x Lineage

Prism has evolved from a simple SQLite session logger into a **Multimodal, Multi-Agent, Self-Learning, Observable AI Operating System**.

### ✅ v4.6.0 — OpenTelemetry Observability

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 🔭 **MCP Root Span** | `mcp.call_tool` wraps every tool invocation. Context propagated via AsyncLocalStorage — no ref-passing. |
| 🎨 **TracingLLMProvider** | Decorator at the factory boundary. Zero changes to vendor adapters (Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic). Instruments text, embedding, and VLM generation. |
| ⚙️ **Worker Spans** | `worker.vlm_caption` in `imageCaptioner.ts` correctly parents fire-and-forget async tasks to the root MCP span. |
| 🔒 **Shutdown Flush** | `shutdownTelemetry()` is step-0 in `lifecycle.ts` — flushes `BatchSpanProcessor` before DBs close on SIGTERM/disconnect. |
| 🖥️ **Dashboard UI** | 🔭 Observability tab: enable toggle, OTLP endpoint, service name, inline Jaeger docker quick-start, ASCII waterfall diagram. |
| ✅ **GDPR-safe** | Span attributes: char counts + sizes only. Never prompt content, embeddings, or base64 image data. |

**Trace waterfall:**
```
mcp.call_tool  [session_save_image, ~50 ms]
  └─ worker.vlm_caption          [~2–5 s, outlives parent ✓]
       └─ llm.generate_image_description  [~1–4 s]
       └─ llm.generate_embedding          [~200 ms]
```

### ✅ v4.5.1 — GDPR Export & Test Hardening

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 📦 **`session_export_memory`** | ZIP export of all project memory (JSON + Markdown). Satisfies GDPR Art. 20 Right to Portability. API keys redacted, embeddings stripped. |
| 🧪 **270 Tests** | Concurrent export safety, API-key redaction edge cases (incl. `db_password` non-redaction regression), MCP contract under concurrent load. |

---

### ✅ v4.5.0 — VLM Multimodal Memory

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 👁️ **Auto-Captioning Pipeline** | `session_save_image` → VLM → handoff visual_memory → ledger entry → inline embedding. Fire-and-forget, never blocks MCP response. |
| 🔍 **Free Semantic Search** | Captions stored as standard ledger entries — `session_search_memory` finds images by meaning with zero schema changes. |
| 🛡️ **Provider Size Guards** | Anthropic 5MB hard cap. Gemini/OpenAI 20MB soft cap. Pre-flight check before API call. |
| 🔄 **OCC Retry on Handoff** | Read-modify-write with 2-attempt OCC retry loop to survive concurrent handoff saves. |

---

### ✅ v4.4.0 — Pluggable LLM Adapters (BYOM)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| 🔌 **Provider Adapters** | OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Gemini, Ollama (local). Split provider: text and embedding independently configurable. |
| 🛡️ **Air-Gapped Mode** | Zero cloud API keys — full local execution via `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. |
| 🔀 **Cost-Optimized** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet + `nomic-embed-text` (free, local) = best-in-class reasoning + free embeddings. |

---

### ✅ v4.3.0 — The Bridge: Knowledge Sync Rules

Active Behavioral Memory meets IDE context. Graduated insights (importance ≥ 7) auto-sync into `.cursorrules` / `.clauderules` via `knowledge_sync_rules` — idempotent sentinel-based file writing.

---

### ✅ v4.2.0 — Project Repo Registry

Dashboard UI maps projects to repo directories. `session_save_ledger` validates `files_changed` paths and warns on mismatch. Dynamic tool descriptions replace `PRISM_AUTOLOAD_PROJECTS` env var — dashboard is sole source of truth.

---

### ✅ v4.1.0 — Auto-Migration & Multi-Instance

Zero-config Supabase schema upgrades via `prism_apply_ddl` RPC on startup. `PRISM_INSTANCE` env var for side-by-side server instances without PID lock conflicts.

---

### ✅ v4.0.0 — Behavioral Memory

`session_save_experience` with event types, confidence scores, and importance decay. Auto-injects correction warnings into `session_load_context`. Dynamic role resolution from dashboard.

---

### ✅ v3.x — Memory Lifecycle & Agent Hivemind

v3.1: Data retention (TTL), auto-compaction, PKM export, analytics sparklines.  
v3.0: Role-scoped memory, agent registration/heartbeat, Telepathy (real-time cross-agent sync).

---

## 🗺️ Next on the Horizon

### Priority 1 — Documentation & Architecture Guide 📚
*(Recommended next session)*

The feature set is exceptional but the README reflects v4.3. Needed:
- Architecture diagram (VLM pipeline, OTel waterfall, Hivemind sync, IDE bridge)
- "How to build a self-improving agent with Prism" canonical guide
- v4.x feature matrix table
- Updated Quick Start reflecting all providers

### Priority 2 — Knowledge Graph Editor 🕸️

Visual graph in Mind Palace Dashboard showing connected nodes:
- Projects ↔ Sessions ↔ Ledger entries ↔ Graduated rules ↔ Agent roles
- Click a node to preview content
- Filter by project, date range, importance threshold

### Priority 3 — Autonomous Web Scholar 🌐

Agent-driven learning pipeline:
1. Brave Search + Firecrawl scrape for a given topic
2. VLM extracts key concepts from diagrams/screenshots
3. Gemini summarizes and deduplicates
4. Results saved as ledger entries → semantically searchable
5. Runs on a cron schedule while the developer sleeps
